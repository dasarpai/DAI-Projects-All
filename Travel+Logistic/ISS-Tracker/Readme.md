This application is 100% created using ChatGPT prompt

## Prompt 
I need your help in creating a prompt for ISS Web App Idea 

Create an web app using React-Js, user-friendly UI, with a navigation bar at the bottom that remains visible and opaque, with two tabs. 


First tab
Fetch the ISS's real-time latitude and longitude from the Open Notify API, and refresh the ISS
location every couple seconds to provide real-time tracking.

Represent the ISS using a custom annotation that has a satellite emoji, and add the standard blue dot from iOS to show the current user location.



Start the map fully zoomed out to see all of Earth, and center it on the ISS

Make sure we have a very smooth transition for the ISS by updating its annotation to the position, it's important that it never disappears. 



Position a semi-transparent overlay towards the bottom the map screen to show "Latitude" and "Longitude" coordinates with while test, as well as "Distance" from the user location



Second tab
List current astronauts wit craft on the right.
Include "X Astronauts in Space" in the title.


Feel free to give me the complete code in one file. Includig guide how to run it on my machine.

### prompt 
mapboxgl is asking for credit card. Is there any other free api with credit card info?

### ChatGPT Said:

If you'd like to avoid using Mapbox because it requires a credit card, here are some free mapping APIs that do not require credit card details and can fulfill your requirements:

### Alternatives to Mapbox:

1. **Leaflet.js (Open Source)**  
   - Free and open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps.
   - Requires no credit card.
   - Works with free tile servers like OpenStreetMap (OSM).

2. **OpenLayers**  
   - Another open-source mapping library.
   - Can integrate with OpenStreetMap or other free tile providers.

3. **Google Maps API Free Tier (Limited)**  
   - Google Maps offers a free tier, but it does require a credit card for account creation. You can use it up to the free limit without being charged.

4. **Here Maps Free Tier**  
   - Offers up to 250,000 map views per month for free.
   - Requires account setup but no credit card for the free tier.

5. **ArcGIS for Developers**  
   - Free developer account with a limited number of map views per month.
   - No credit card is required for the free tier.

### Suggested Approach: Use Leaflet.js + OpenStreetMap

Here's how to replace Mapbox with **Leaflet.js** and **OpenStreetMap** in your application:

---

#### Code Example for ISS Tracker with Leaflet.js:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import "leaflet/dist/leaflet.css";
import L from "leaflet";
import "./styles.css";

const App = () => {
  const [issLocation, setIssLocation] = useState({ lat: 0, lng: 0 });
  const [userLocation, setUserLocation] = useState({ lat: 0, lng: 0 });
  const [distance, setDistance] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Fetch user location
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
      ({ coords }) => {
        setUserLocation({ lat: coords.latitude, lng: coords.longitude });
      },
      (error) => console.error("Error getting user location:", error)
    );

    // Initialize Leaflet map
    const map = L.map("map").setView([0, 0], 2);
    L.tileLayer("https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png", {
      attribution: "&copy; OpenStreetMap contributors",
    }).addTo(map);

    const issMarker = L.marker([0, 0], {
      icon: L.divIcon({
        className: "custom-icon",
        html: "🛰️",
      }),
    }).addTo(map);

    const userMarker = L.marker([0, 0], {
      icon: L.divIcon({
        className: "user-icon",
        html: "🔵",
      }),
    }).addTo(map);

    // Fetch ISS location every 2 seconds
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      fetch("http://api.open-notify.org/iss-now.json")
        .then((res) => res.json())
        .then((data) => {
          const { latitude, longitude } = data.iss_position;
          const lat = parseFloat(latitude);
          const lng = parseFloat(longitude);
          setIssLocation({ lat, lng });
          issMarker.setLatLng([lat, lng]);
          map.setView([lat, lng], map.getZoom());

          if (userLocation.lat && userLocation.lng) {
            const dist = calculateDistance(lat, lng, userLocation.lat, userLocation.lng);
            setDistance(dist.toFixed(2));
          }
        });
    }, 2000);

    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, [userLocation]);

  const calculateDistance = (lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2) => {
    const toRad = (value) => (value * Math.PI) / 180;
    const R = 6371; // Earth's radius in km
    const dLat = toRad(lat2 - lat1);
    const dLon = toRad(lon2 - lon1);
    const a =
      Math.sin(dLat / 2) * Math.sin(dLat / 2) +
      Math.cos(toRad(lat1)) * Math.cos(toRad(lat2)) *
      Math.sin(dLon / 2) * Math.sin(dLon / 2);
    const c = 2 * Math.atan2(Math.sqrt(a), Math.sqrt(1 - a));
    return R * c;
  };

  return (
    <div className="app">
      <div id="map" style={{ height: "100vh", width: "100%" }}></div>
      <div className="overlay">
        <p>Latitude: {issLocation.lat}</p>
        <p>Longitude: {issLocation.lng}</p>
        <p>Distance: {distance} km</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

---

### Steps to Run:
1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install leaflet
   ```

2. **Replace Code:**
   Replace your existing React `App.js` with the code above.

3. **Add Styles (styles.css):**
   ```css
   #map {
     height: 100%;
     width: 100%;
   }
   .overlay {
     position: absolute;
     bottom: 10px;
     left: 10px;
     background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
     color: white;
     padding: 10px;
     border-radius: 5px;
   }
   ```

4. **Run the App:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

This solution uses **Leaflet.js** with OpenStreetMap tiles and avoids requiring a credit card. Let me know if you need further guidance!

### Prompt: Where is index.js code?

### ChatGPT Said 

I didn't include the `index.js` file in the previous response, but here's the basic setup for it. This file is the entry point for rendering the React application:

### `index.js`
```javascript
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import "./styles.css"; // Import your styles
import App from "./App"; // Import the main App component

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

### Steps:
1. Place this file in the `src` folder as `index.js`.
2. Ensure your `App.js` file (main component) is in the same folder (`src`).
3. Make sure you have a `styles.css` file in `src` for custom styles.

Let me know if you'd like help setting up the project structure!

This application is not working 


his is an ISS tracking app. This app is not running. Can you fix this?

To help you fix the issue with your ISS tracking app, I'll need to perform a few steps:

Review the index.js and app.js files: These files likely contain the main logic for your application. I'll check them for any errors or missing configurations.
Check for errors in the console: If there are any error messages, they can guide us to the root cause of the problem.
Let's start by reviewing the contents of the index.js and app.js files to identify any potential issues. I'll begin by viewing the first 200 lines of each file.

Analyzed

index.js:(1-51)
Analyzed

app.js:(1-51)
The index.js and app.js files appear to be set up correctly for a React application. Here are some things to check and consider:

Ensure Dependencies are Installed: Make sure all required dependencies like react, react-dom, and leaflet are installed. You can check this by looking at your package.json file or by running npm list.
Check for Errors in the Console: If there are any errors in the browser's console, they can provide clues about what might be going wrong.
Verify HTML File: Ensure that there is an HTML file with an element having the ID root, as this is where the React app is being mounted.
Network Requests: The app fetches data from http://api.open-notify.org/iss-now.json. Ensure that this request is successful and not blocked by any network issues.
Geolocation Permissions: The app uses the browser's geolocation API. Make sure that geolocation permissions are granted.
Let's start by checking if the necessary dependencies are installed by viewing the package.json file. If you don't have this file, let me know, and I can help you create it.

package.json:(1-51)
The package.json file currently only lists leaflet as a dependency. It seems like the essential dependencies for a React application, such as react and react-dom, are missing. This could be the reason why the app is not running.

Let's add the necessary dependencies to the package.json file and then install them. I'll update the package.json file to include react and react-dom, and then proceed to install these packages.

I have updated the package.json file to include react and react-dom as dependencies. The installation of these packages is now in progress. Once the installation is complete, you should try running your application again.

If you encounter any errors or need further assistance, please let me know!

Me

@terminal_selection what is this issue?

The error message indicates that there is no start script defined in the package.json file. This script is typically used to start a Node.js application, and without it, the npm start command doesn't know what to execute.

To resolve this issue, we need to add a start script to the package.json file. This script should specify the command to start your React application. Usually, for a React app created using tools like Create React App, the start script is "start": "react-scripts start". However, since I don't see any indication that Create React App is being used, we may need to manually configure it.

Let's add a basic start script to your package.json file. If you have a specific way to start your application, please let me know, and I can adjust the script accordingly. Otherwise, I'll proceed with a general setup.

Please fix the issue. this app is not working.

I've made several important changes to fix your ISS Tracker application:

Created a proper React application structure with:
/public/index.html as the entry point
/src directory containing the main application files
Moved and updated the main application files to the correct locations
Updated package.json with:
Proper React dependencies including react-scripts
Added necessary npm scripts (start and build)
Added proper browser configurations
Organized the application files:
Moved App.js to the src directory
Created a new index.js in the src directory
Moved styles.css to the src directory
The application should now start properly with npm start. It will open in your default web browser at http://localhost:3000. The app will track the International Space Station's location in real-time, showing:

The ISS location on an interactive map
The current latitude and longitude
The distance between your location and the ISS
Make sure to allow location access in your browser when prompted, as the app needs it to calculate the distance between you and the ISS.
